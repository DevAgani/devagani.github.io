I still remember the thrill of those early days, back in 2008, when I first laid my hands on a computer. In a town where computers were scarce, it was a privilege to even have access to one. I was among the lucky few who enrolled in the coveted "Computer packages Course" after finishing high school.


Learning the basics was a game changes. The simple act of right-clicking, for instance, opened up a world of possibilities. Creating folders, refreshing the desktop, deleting filesâ€”it was like unlocking secret powers. And then there was the excitement of seeing the insides of a computer. Disassembling and reassembling a PC, and even installing Windows 98, were thrilling experiences.

It was clear from that point on that computers would be a lifelong passion. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, a unique program that combined theoretical foundations with practical application. While the early years were heavily focused on mathematics, I was eager to dive into the world of computing.

Shortly after my graduation, I landed a dream job as a Software Engineer at a utility software company. It was a steep learning curve, but I was excited to apply my skills and contribute to real-world projects. The experience provided a solid foundation for my future career.

I've had the opportunity to embark on a thrilling tech career journey. From switching companies to relocating for a dream role, it's been quite a ride. 

Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, there's always something new to learn and discover.
